What is a good racing track? Some thoughts.
Fairly wide as overtaking will be easy.
Straights should be ruler straight and long enough for a realistic overtaking attempt.
Overtaking seldom happens in a technical section, they should therefore be short.
A short track has a short average distance between the cars, i.e. more interaction.
Some difficulties as to make mistakes more likely.
